# STOCKANALYSIS
This is a python project for Data Science focusing on extracting and visualizing stock data.
The main job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data you will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla and GameStop.
